            <h7>Noah's mother Patricia played a pivotal role in Noah's life, the way he behaved<br> and lived.
                Patricia made sacrifices -many- for her son Noah. Even though she <br> faced numerous
                hardshipds like poverty and violence, she always struggled to <br>give Noah a good life, she
                desciplined Noah but showered him with endless love.<br> Patricia made sure that her son knew
                more than one language because she believed<br> communication was the key and especially in a place
                like Apatheid where people of<br> color were being descrimanted since they had no belonging not either
                to black <br> community nor white. Atleast Noah knowing different languages made people around <br>him
                feel safe
                and more welcoming to him and it gave Noah a sense of belonging,<br>Patricia also instilled a sense of
                morality
                in Noah which helped him grow up without <br>being violent even thou he faced violence.<br><br>

                In the book Noah also talks about how his resilient mother (Patricia) influenced his <br>outlook on
                life.
                Despite of theoppression of Arpetheid environment, Patricia tought him<br> to find humor and hope in
                difficult
                situations.<br> <br>
                "My mother; A life of love and resiliend" would be my time for Born a crime because the <br> book
                consistently
                came around Patricia, her life and how her love and resilience shaped <br> Noah to be who he was today
                by discipling
                him but also making sure she gave him all she <br> had to make Noah have a good life and also survive in
                Apartheid.

            <h4>The <br>Quote</h4>
            <h6>"Abel wanted a traditional marriage<br> with atraditional wife...
                but he never in <br>love with subservient women ... He only <br>wants
                a woman who is free because his <br>dream is to put her in a cage.
            </h6>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h7>
                The quote talks about Abel's desire for a traditional marriage with a traditional wife while <br>attracted to
                independent women. It shows how menwant partners who embodies traditonal <br>feminity while also being attracted
                to independent women.<br>
                As traditional roles indicated that men should be dominant and  providers while women are<br> expected to be submissive
                to the men, but in today's world there implications are being are <br>being challenged. Modern women seek equality in
                relationships;wanting partners who respect<br> their independence and ambitions.<br>
                As much as women want to be independent, men want to have contol over them which was <br>defined as "Desire to put he in 
                a cage". This conflicts men's traditional desire where women are <br>expected to be submissive with modern relationships
                where men get attracted to partners who<br> challenge them and contribute to the relationship equally.<br>

                Concluding the quote relates to today's world where men are attracted to medern independent<br> women but also conflicts
                with men's desire for control where they want submissive women.  <br><br>
                
                While today's relationships are expected to be 50/50 - men and women put the same effort-, when <br>it comes to marriage 
                men's desire for control comesin; they want totake it the traditional way by <br>expecting their wivesto be submissive for
                example being house wives while forgeting they never<br> married a traditional wife in the first place. Thats what leads
                to today's marriages ending up in <br>divorce now and then.

            Trevor Noah is one of the most successful comedians in the world and was the host of the Emmy® <br>Award-winning “The Daily Show”
            on Comedy Central for seven years. Under Trevor, “The Daily <br>Show with Trevor Noah” broke free from the restraints of a 30-minute
            linear show, producing engaging<br> social content, award-winning digital series, podcasts and more for its global audience. Last year,<br>
            “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah” landed a record number of seven Emmy Award nominations.<br>
            Trevor is the author of the #1 New York Times bestseller “Born a Crime: Stories from a South African<br> Childhood” and its young readers
            adaptation, released in 2019, “It’s Trevor Noah: Born a Crime: Stories<br> from a South African Childhood,” which also debuted as a New York
            Times bestseller. The Audible edition <br>of “Born a Crime,” performed by Trevor, was produced by Audible and remains one of the top-selling,<br>
            highest-rated, and most-commented-on Audible performances of all time. To date, “Born a Crime” has sold<br> over 3 million copies across all
            formats.<br>
            Trevor has written, produced, and starred in 12 comedy specials, including Emmy-nominated “I Wish You<br> Would,” his third for Netflix, which
            premiered globally in November 2022. True to form, Trevor hilariously<br> shares revelations about learning to speak German, modern communication,
            and his love for curry. His<br> previous special, “Trevor Noah: Son of Patricia” received a NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Variety<br> Show, as well 
            as a Grammy Award nomination.<br>
            In 2018, Noah launched the Trevor Noah Foundation to improve equitable access to quality education for underserved youth in South Africa. Noah's
            vision is a world where education enables youth to dream, see<br>
             and build the impossible.
